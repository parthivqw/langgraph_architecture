First, an AI model enhances the user's initial prompt and decides which specific text fields (like headline, CTA, testimonial) are needed. Second, another AI model takes this plan and generates the creative text content for each of those selected fields. Third, all of this generated content is assembled into a final, detailed prompt. Finally, that prompt is sent to an image generation model to create the poster.",
